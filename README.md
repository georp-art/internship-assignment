The backend is built with SpringBoot using layered architecture(repositories,services,controllers). Repositories usie Spring Data JPA to connect with the database(PostgreSQL). Services contain core application logic
and interact with repositories. Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses. APIs are secured via JWT and tested using Postman. The entire service is using Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for environment setup.
